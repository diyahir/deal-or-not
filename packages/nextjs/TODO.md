<!-- TODO: delete this after done -->

1. We only show the offer price when it is the time to sign. "Deal" accepts the offer. We bring back "no deal" button which calls eliminateBoxes
2. We rename "Pick 5 more" to "Open 5 vaults" etc.
3. We could toast the price of the case that just opened, this way we would give more impact after each case it is opened. Toast could say: "You opened vault 22, value: 20 gMON"
4. Quantities depend on game amount you are playing
5. Notify about state of game, however that would take longer for now it just starts a new game on a reload
